== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why this plugin? =

Normal Facebook comments plugins will drag your website speed down. This plugin won't.

= Wait, how? =

By lazy loading FB scripts and comments only when needed.

= Please explain, how this plugin lazy loads? =

Comments and scripts will be loaded only after user clicking on a "Load Comments" (of course you can customize this button text too) button, or after scrolling down. You select any of these lazy load methods.

= How can I add custom post type support? =

It's easy. You can use `lfc_supported_post_types` filter to add custom post type support. Add following line to your theme's functions.php or in your custom plugin.


`
add_filter( 'lfc_supported_post_types', 'mycustom_add_lfc_cpt_support' );

function mycustom_add_lfc_cpt_support( $post_types ) {
    // Here mycpt is your custom post type name.
    $post_types[] = 'mycpt';

    return $post_types;
}
`
= Where can I moderate the comments? =

Once you configure the plugin with APP ID, you will find the moderation page link on the plugin settings page.
